					<h3>Project Overview</h3>
					<h3 class="greytitles">Overview</h3>
					<p>PharmaForesight.ai needed a frontend to demo their disruptive AI algorithm to drugs manufacturers in just 3-weeks, and didn’t have the design + frontend development skills amongst their Machine Learning experience.</p>

					<p>PharmaForesight are an AI startup disrupting the Pharma industry, by developing a unique algorithm that can predict the probability of success of a drug trial, before hundreds of thousands are spent on the trial itself. Our client, Eddie has a Distinction from UCL MSc Machine Learning, which is where Google’s DeepMind came from.</p>

							I chose to work with Calibre because of their clear communication from the beginning, both at a technical and a business level. What I really appreciated was when they advised me on ringfencing the scope by writing mock APIs, and helped me prioritise features based on their potential effort, which reduced the timelines and budgets for the project.<br/><br/>
							Calibre delivered exactly what we agreed at the beginning, and I'll certainly reach out to Calibre first for future frontend product development support.<strong><br> - Eddie Pease<br> - Co-founder, PharmaForesight</strong>

							<p>For most of our projects, matching the brief isn’t going to get a clients’ project over the finish line, so we started by focussing on what “success” looks like for this project.</p>
							<p>By understanding that the purpose of this tool is to show off their AI algorithm to potential clients during a Demo Meeting, where someone will be describing and operating it in-person, we understood which parts of the brief should be challenged (for example, having the tool on 2 pages).</p>
							<p>We were also able to recommend using query parameters in the URL, which means they can click one of many pre-made links during the meeting, and voila! All the drug names, NLM identifiers, etc are pre-populated, ready to press the big exciting “Predict” button.</p>

					<div class="js-Accordion" id="accordion2">

						<div>
							<p>Startups depend on being resourceful, and we found an opportunity to collaborate with a business-savvy & tech-savvy client to engineer some serious value in a limited budget.</p>
							<p>By developing API blueprints, defining each persons’ responsibility upfront, and being clear the project’s requirements (in terms of skills and experience), we were able to appoint someone who could bring his service design experience, visual design eye, and then write clean React.js code for a snappy frontend-only single page app (SPA). It takes a good project plan, and a the right contractor to be able to deliver a project at this level.</p>

							<p>When our client has a Demo Meeting that’s under a month away, we’ll see if we can rise to the challenge. For this project, Calibre’s Director and PharmaForesight’s Founder came together and planned the project in a 1hr meeting, and email communication was kept concise, clear, and complete. By the time we kicked the project off, Joshua had all the information + assets at the ready, and was able to start crafting.</p>
							<p>To avoid slowing him down, we agreed to treat feedback as “suggestions” to Joshua, and let him have final say over how he met our brief. All of these efforts paid off when the project was ready to demo in under 2 weeks.</p>

							<h3>CALIBRE TIP</h3>

						</div>
						<p class="tipquote">
							When managing frontend and backend work at the same time, the best way to clarify the responsibility of each party is by writing API documentation upfront. By defining this “interface”, you can avoid huge delays in a project, where both developers could be emailing back and forth requesting changes to each others’ work in order for their own codebase to function correctly. <a href="https://www.getpostman.com">We use postman for mock APIs.</a><br/><br/>
							p.s. Generally, this API documentation should be written by the frontend developer.
