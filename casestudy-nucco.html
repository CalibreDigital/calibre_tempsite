					<h3>Project Overview</h3>
					<h3 class="greytitles">Overview</h3>
					<p>Nucco Brain were initially looking for a small, agile team to manage and update their existing website. As our relationship grew, Calibre helped upskill their internal team, leveraging their animation talent on the web for paying clients.</p>
					<p>They chose Calibre because of our flexibility, and remain both a client and a partner 4 years.</p>

							As we are a growing company, we are constantly making changes and iterations to our website, and Anthony and Jerome are always helpful and patient with me and my team.<br/><br/>
							The best thing about working with Calibre Digital is that they provide feedback on our suggestions, which feels more like a partnership. I highly recommend them as you emerge on your own digital journey!<br><strong>- Hilary Taylor<br> - Marketing Executive</strong>

					<h3>ABOUT NUCCO BRAIN</h3>
					<h3 class="greytitles">About</h3>
					<p>Nucco Brain are an award-winning visual storytelling studio based in London, with a pan-European presence. They specialise in telling the stories of established brands, bringing innovative twists to both the narrative itself and the delivery, whether through traditional video, animation or even VR.</p>

						<div>
							<p>How do you find the perfect positioning for you when website changes are hard to prototype, expensive, and take time to see in the flesh?</p>
							<p>By working with Nucco Brain’s designers to develop appropriate web design workflows for them, they were soon able to rapid-prototype website iterations in-house, and call us in to code & publish once they had something that felt right. These iterations continued for 3 years until they found a positioning that was clear enough to hire a sales team and be acquired by a larger company: Two of the hardest transitions for an Agency founder.</p>

					<p><strong>As a team of talented animators and illustrators, it made sense for Nucco Brain to showcase that talent on the web</strong></p>
					<div class="js-Accordion" id="accordion2">
						<p id="expandtrigger" class="challenge-cta">But video files are so heavy that you can’t use them in many ways on a website.</p>
						<div>
							<p>Video files are contained within a rectangle and take a while to load. There’s certainly a place for them on the web, but Nucco Brain’s brand deserved a better method of implementing animation.</p>
							<p>By leveraging a framework called lottie.js and Bodymovin, we enabled Nucco Brain to create beautiful SVG animations (which are much more lightweight and versatile) in their animation style. With this high-performance animation capability available to them, Nucco Brain were able to start offering professional and animated web design as a service to their cleints.</p>

							<h3 style="text-align: left;">CALIBRE TIP</h3>
							<p class="tipquote">
								If you want to do something interesting (in our case, SVG animation), there might already be an open source solution available. In our case we found Bodymovin and Lottie.js, which is maintained by Airbnb.<br/><br/>
								Note: You’ll need to properly evaluate an open-source project before including it though: badly-made projects can also be a liability in your codebase.
