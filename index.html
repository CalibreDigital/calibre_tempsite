					<h3>Delivery - it's not rocket science</h3>
					<p>We do software development the way it should be done, which means you can afford to be creative and strategic in the knowledge that we'll deliver.</p>
					<p>It's not rocket science, it's just experience: scanning a project before kickoff, flagging the risks, and resolving them upfront. Then, well-managed projects attract the best developers onto our books, which is a win-win-win really.</p>

					<h3>Digtial savvy</h3>

							<h3>European Space Agency</h3>
							<p>ESA BA worked with a Visual Storytelling Studio, Marketing Agency, and ourselves with the aim to grow grant applications by 70%. Calibre started by recording user research videos, used illustrations to enable the imagination, and finished by coding the UI designs that we had pitched.</p>

							<h3>Google DeepMind</h3>
							<p>DeepMind is one of the worlds leading (and most secretive) AI organisations in the world, and is likely to play a significant role in the future of humanity. Calibre's creative team was involved to explore the scientific relevance of AI into the past and the future as we contributed towards an internal corp comms initiative.</p>

							<h3>Rockpool Investments</h3>
							<p>We rebranded the companys logo, offices, print & digital assets, but the Gutenberg powered Wordpress theme we made them was ahead of its time. Their bespoke page editor is as dynamic as the company itself and every time we load the website we spot a change they've made without having to pick up the phone to ask our help.</p>

							<h3>Subutai</h3>
							<p>This cyber startup's impressive product scans the millions of devices in an enterprise to reveal their cyber risk profile. Calibre was fist involved as product consultants, where we campaigned for a new architecture that sped up development by at least 5x. We later built their website at <a href="https://esc.co" target="_blank">esc.co</a>.</p>

							<h3>Nucco Brain</h3>
							<p>As consultants, we coached the graphic designers at this Visual Storytelling Studio to "design for the web" so they could start selling websites using their unique illustration style.<br/>
							As developers, we deliver pixel-perfect code whenever they redesign <a href="https://nuccobrain.com" target="_blank">their website</a>, published with a 2-week turnaround.</p>

					<h3>Calibre Culture</h3>
					<p>Our mission is to make the cutting edge of digital product design as accessible as possible to our partners.</p>
					<p>Considering how fast the landscape of tools, workflows, and design patterns are changing, we've built a culture around learning, and we're never going to stop sharpening our axe.</p>
				</header>



				<section class="special">
					<div class="box container">
						<h3>Calibre Community</h3>
						<p>We find that the best way to stay on the cutting edge of digital is by being plugged into a network of brilliant entrepreneurs, contractors, and mentors.</p>
						<p>We've learnt from remote teams like Zapier, Buffer, and freelance collectives how to get a new contractor up to speed in a flash. That means seamless onboarding, documented design decisions, and communication that can't be misunderstood. </p>

						<h3>Why should you care?</h3>
						<p>We developed a unique way of working because we value efficiency, confidence, and creativity, and this is what you really tap into when working with Calibre.</p>
						<p>Do you want a project plan you can rely on? Do you want to hop on a videocall with no audio lag? Or perhaps see a staging website constantly evolve as we code? Want to receive the most useful and clear emails you've ever seen from a Agency? Some of our clients might informally admit that the culture of clean, effective, well-communicated, and intelligent work is the reason they keep coming up with website ideas for us to build, sprint, after sprint, after sprint.</p>
