				<p>Digital Product Studio</p>

<!-- Calibre was founded upon one core curiosity: "How smart can we get about making Digital Products?"

We're smart and lazy so you'd expect us to spot quick-wins. You wouldn't expect us to give those shortcuts to you

With a wealth of experience as a founder, freelancer, and agency owner, we created a studio that revolves around the question "Why?". Once we're satisfied with the answer, we'll work with you to aggressively pursue the best solution.

You'll usually find our Shoreditch studio working with senior managers or founders, because 

We let our testimonials from clients at the Financial Times, the European Space Agency, and the companies we shouldnâ€™t talk about too publicly speak for itself.

					<h3>Delivery - it's not rocket science</h3>
					<p>With an experienced founding team, Calibre has nailed frontend web development: If we had perfect specs every time, then delivering on-time, and on-budget isn't enough for us to break a sweat. Take a look at <a href="#portfolio">our portfolio</a> below.</p>
					<p>[Can delete this paragraph:] Of course, a healthy happy team enjoys a bit of creative R&D - and we allocate a ton of spare time towards experimenting! After all, our core team are developers and entrepreneurs at heart, so any wasted energy in our workflow makes us cringe, and delivering code on time, as you expect it, every time, is bread and butter.</p>
				</header>

				<header class="major container medium">
					<h3>Digtial savvy</h3>
					<p>Whilst we spend half our time weaving code, we spend the other half of our time thinking about how code should be woven.</p>
					<p>If you'd benefit from consultants that practice what they preach, consider involving us; We run innovation workshops, help set up digital transformation teams, coach product managers, and mentor tech startup founders at <a href="https://developers.google.com/programs/launchpad/">Google Launchpad</a> and <a href="https://www.kickstartldn.co.uk/">Kickstart London</a>.</p>

							<h3>European Space Agency</h3>
							<p>ESA BA worked with a Visual Storytelling Studio, Marketing Agency, and ourselves with the aim to grow grant applications by 70%. Calibre started by recording user research videos, used illustrations to enable the imagination, and finished by coding the UI designs that we had pitched.</p>

							<h3>Google DeepMind</h3>
							<p>DeepMind is one of the worlds leading (and most secretive) AI organisations in the world, and is likely to play a significant role in the future of humanity. Calibre's creative team was involved to explore the scientific relevance of AI into the past and the future as we contributed towards an internal corp comms initiative.</p>

							<h3>Rockpool Investments</h3>
							<p>We rebranded the companys logo, offices, print & digital assets, but the Gutenberg powered Wordpress theme we made them was ahead of its time. Their bespoke page editor is as dynamic as the company itself and every time we load the website we spot a change they've made without having to pick up the phone to ask our help.</p>

							<h3>Subutai</h3>
							<p>This cyber startup's impressive product scans the millions of devices in an enterprise to reveal their cyber risk profile. Calibre was fist involved as product consultants, where we campaigned for a new architecture that sped up development by at least 5x. We later built their website at <a href="https://esc.co" target="_blank">esc.co</a>.</p>

							<h3>Nucco Brain</h3>
							<p>As consultants, we coached the graphic designers at this Visual Storytelling Studio to "design for the web" so they could start selling websites using their unique illustration style.<br/>

					<h3>Calibre Culture</h3>
					<p>Our mission is to make the cutting edge of digital product design as accessible as possible to our partners.</p>
					<p>Considering how fast the landscape of tools, workflows, and design patterns are changing, we've built a culture around learning, and we're never going to stop sharpening our axe.</p>
				</header>



				<section class="special">
					<div class="box container">
						<h3>Calibre Community</h3>
						<p>We find that the best way to stay on the cutting edge of digital is by being plugged into a network of brilliant entrepreneurs, contractors, and mentors.</p>
						<p>We've learnt from remote teams like Zapier, Buffer, and freelance collectives how to get a new contractor up to speed in a flash. That means seamless onboarding, documented design decisions, and communication that can't be misunderstood. </p>

						<h3>Why should you care?</h3>
						<p>We developed a unique way of working because we value efficiency, confidence, and creativity, and this is what you really tap into when working with Calibre.</p>
						<p>Do you want a project plan you can rely on? Do you want to hop on a videocall with no audio lag? Or perhaps see a staging website constantly evolve as we code? Want to receive the most useful and clear emails you've ever seen from a Agency? Some of our clients might informally admit that the culture of clean, effective, well-communicated, and intelligent work is the reason they keep coming up with website ideas for us to build, sprint, after sprint, after sprint.</p>
