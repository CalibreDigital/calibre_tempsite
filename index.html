<!-- Calibre was founded upon one core curiosity: "How smart can we get about making Digital Products?"

We're smart and lazy so you'd expect us to spot quick-wins. You wouldn't expect us to give those shortcuts to you

With a wealth of experience as a founder, freelancer, and agency owner, we created a studio that revolves around the question "Why?". Once we're satisfied with the answer, we'll work with you to aggressively pursue the best solution.

You'll usually find our Shoreditch studio working with senior managers or founders, because 

We let our testimonials from clients at the Financial Times, the European Space Agency, and the companies we shouldn’t talk about too publicly speak for itself.

					<h3>WHAT MAKES A CALIBRE TEAM</h3>
					<p>Unlike other agencies, our Project Managers are full-stack technologists who can read code, create designs, and understand your business needs. This means when our developers get to their desk, they've got all the information they need in one place, so they can focus on writing modular, robust, and flexible code.</p>
					<p><!-- No juggling multiple tasks waiting for a response, no design adjustments within a development environment full of code, and no time is spent looking for non-existent bugs. --> It's little things like this that mean Calibre can turn around projects in a month, where a normal agency engagement takes three.</p>
					<p>Well, actually our record for bespoke design + development of a website is a week, end to end. Check out the final result on our <a href="https://calibrestaging-vwtico.netlify.com/" target="_blank">staging site</a>.</p>
