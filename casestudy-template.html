					<h3>Project Overview</h3>
					<h3 class="greytitles">Overview</h3>
					<p>Subutai was building version 4 of their product, and it had to transform the company from no revenue to a profitable business.</p>
					<p>They chose Calibre because our bespoke proposal drew from our experience with architecture, product design, devops workflow, cybersecurity, and effective team coaching.</p>

					<h3>ABOUT SUBUTAI</h3>
					<h3 class="greytitles">About</h3>
					<p>Subutai was an InsurTech startup that raised funding nearly a year prior. Their first cybersecurity product scanned millions of data points to generate visualisations on the fly, and was used to determine the risk profile of an enterprise from an insurance perspective.</p>

						<p id="expandtrigger" class="challenge-cta">Expand to see how we brought clarity with high fidelity design specs</p>
						<div>
							<p>With such a complex product, the product and the engineering lead were imagining different things whenever they discussed how it should work. This was why the last three versions of the product weren’t quite commercially usable by the time they were built.</p>
							<p>By shifting their conversation from user needs to final design solutions, we coached the team to create a UI design specification that solved all of the challenges in one product.</p>

						<p id="expandtrigger" class="challenge-cta">Expand to see how their CTO implemented a modular architecture</p>
						<div>
							<p>We noticed the engineering challenges were unnecessecarily complicated and the team needed a more modular architecture - one that separated the dependencies and allowed developers to work on one part of the system without breaking things elsewhere.</p>
							<p>Instead of designing a new architecture for them, we just asked them to replacing their bespoke query language with GraphQL. We knew GraphQL would structure their codebase for them, and therefore make it possible to work on one part of the codebase without having to consider the impact elsewhere.</p>

						<div>
							<p>Once the team implemented a modular architecture, we were able to efficiently start solving engineering challenges across differnet modules. To speed things up further, we reached out to a network of niche experts who had faced similar problems before. We soon coordinated with:</p>
							<p>An <strong>Elasticsearch</strong> expert to efficiently scan millions of data points.</p>
							<p>A <strong>React.js</strong> developer to build a new frontend.</p>
							<p>A <strong>DevOps</strong> studio for continuous integration and deployment pipelines.</p>

							When needing a niche expert to help us, codementor.io has helped us countless times and we recommend you check it out. For this project, we found an Elasticsearch expert on the platform and she was happy to help us figure anything out.

					<p>After six weeks of engagement with Calibre, the Subutai team went ahead to build their first sellable product within 3 months. They quickly sold their first licences, and became a profitable company within a year.</p>
