			<h2 class="lead">Hello,</h2>
			<div class="lead-text">
				<p>From my profile below, you'll see that I'm deeply passionate about people and technology, and am now looking for an opportunity to have a lasting impact with your team.</p>

				<p><span style="font-weight: 500;">As a technical product strategist,</span> my tested consultancy process starts with the business goals and building product thinking on top of that. Building a product vision, scope, team, technical approach, and roadmap will then follow, based on the needs of your team. This is appropriate for new and existing products for startups, SMEs, and corporate innovation.</p>

				<p><span style="font-weight: 500;">As an interim manager,</span> you can bring me in to manage the transition between two key players, or set up and execute a new project. At Nucco Brain, I spent 3 months filling in for their senior project manager, owning up to 26 simultaneous projects, whilst maturing the processes in preparation for the higher level PM that the company was interviewing for. This growth was in the lead up to a successful acquisition starting 6 months later.</p>

				<p>If you're looking to launch a new project, you're a high growth company, or you're facing a unique challenge, let's hop on a call and explore it together.</p>
